# Documentation

Start here to understand HyphaMind’s approach and how to work with our systems.

## Getting Started
- Monorepo Quickstart (30 seconds): https://github.com/hyphamind-ai/hyphaMind#start-here-30-seconds
- Docs vNext Trailhead: https://github.com/hyphamind-ai/hyphaMind/blob/main/docs/vnext/README.md

## Core Concepts
- Coherence Engine loop: ROOT → VALVE → CLASP → TRACE → MIRE → SCAR → COMPOST → **ECHO** → SPORE
- Consent-first orchestration and reversible intelligence
- Receipts and provenance by default

## References
- Whitepaper (living SoT): {{ site.whitepaper_url | default: '/whitepaper/' }}
- API & Guides: tracked in the monorepo; public snapshots land here as they stabilize
