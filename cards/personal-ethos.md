## Personal Ethos

I live close to the work: coherence over charisma, reciprocity over extraction, repair over blame, reversibility over bravado. I’ve moved from redneck to regalia and back again, and I know the difference between a thrill that empties me and a thrill that wakes the field. My daily practice is to breathe with the system—attend, clasp, trace, compost—and keep consent audible in every move.

**Guiding principles**  
- **Consent before cadence.** Nothing runs without ROOT and VALVE.  
- **Trace what you love.** If it matters, it leaves a span.  
- **Make merges reversible.** Integrity moves faster than certainty when exits are kind.

This is stewardship, not spectacle. The work is to build membranes where people and machines can meet with receipts and leave with dignity. If that resonates, bring your dataset, your question, your doubt. We can **TRACE → MIRE → SCAR → COMPOST**, then listen for the **ECHO**—the emergent trait we didn’t plan but can learn from. Let’s *trace the loop together*.
