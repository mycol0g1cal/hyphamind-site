## HyphaMind Labs

HyphaMind Labs is the applied arm of the whitepaper: a place where governance becomes capability and experiments ship with receipts. We turn the consent-first grammar—**ROOT → VALVE → CLASP → TRACE → MIRE → SCAR → COMPOST → ECHO → SPORE**—into working pipelines across science and civic tech.

### Current Pilots
- **Wastewater Intelligence:** provenance-complete sampling → analysis → signed SPORE exports; campus/community dashboards with revocable consent.  
- **Bio-Digital Interop:** multi-omics vertical linking reactor conditions (pH×T×RT) to proteome/transcriptome/genome with hash-chained spans.  
- **Community Consent Tooling:** lightweight CLASP receipts + VALVE policies for neighborhood data collaboratives.

### Pipeline
- **SPORE Verify:** public artifact verification and reader-recoverability metrics.  
- **MIRE/ECHO Dash:** reflex telemetry + spandrel discovery for emergent virtues.  
- **Standards Bridge:** profiles for ISO/IEC 27560 receipts and supply-chain signing (sigstore).

Labs feeds findings back into the whitepaper on a regular rhythm; when the field teaches us something new, we update the grammar and the code.
