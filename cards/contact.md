## Contact & Collaborations

We welcome careful partners, curious communities, and press who care about accountability as much as acceleration. If you have data that needs receipts, models that need lineage, or people who deserve reversibility, let’s start a small smoke test and see what hums.

**Collaboration channels**  
- Pilots & research: `labs@hyphamind.ai`  
- Community requests: `community@hyphamind.ai`  
- Signal: `@hyphamindlabs`

Encrypted channels (and scoped data rooms) are available on request. Our protocol is simple: ROOT a shared scope, exchange CLASP grants, run a tiny smoke, and ship a signed **SPORE** preview. We’ll TRACE what matters, honor MIRE pauses, SCAR what fails, COMPOST what’s learned, and listen for **ECHO**. Then—only then—scale.
