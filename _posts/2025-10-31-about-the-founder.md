## About the Founder

Dr. Michael J. Shreve is an environmental engineer and systems designer whose work spans wastewater intelligence, microbial ecology, and multi-omics—now focused on ethical co-creation at HyphaMind Labs. Trained at Penn State (CEE/AgEng) and battle-tested on campus wastewater surveillance, he pairs rigorous reactor-scale research with humane infrastructure design. His practice treats governance as an instrument, not a checklist, translating ecological sense into software that can listen, repair, and evolve.

HyphaMind’s grammar—**ROOT → VALVE → CLASP → TRACE → MIRE → SCAR → COMPOST → ECHO → SPORE**—turns consent, provenance, and reversibility into runtime behavior. Michael’s stewardship centers accountability and reproducibility without losing the creative hum: signed exports, auditable spans, and “vibe harness” CI keep velocity honest.

Across labs and communities, he works to make interop real: data with receipts, models with lineage, collaborations with revocable consent. The aim isn’t scale for its own sake; it’s integrity under acceleration.
