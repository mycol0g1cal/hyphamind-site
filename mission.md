  <h2 class="mt-0">Mission</h2>
  <p class="mt-1">We build <strong>audit-ready, reversible AI</strong> that grows like an ecosystem—where <strong>consent is the climate</strong>, <strong>receipts are the growth rings</strong>, and intelligence emerges <strong>chorally</strong> from many small, accountable parts.</p>

  <h3 class="mt-2 subhead-sm">What we do (in three practices)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Composting.</strong> We transform messy, risky data into privacy-preserving, provenance-linked artifacts—useful soil instead of hoarded raw inputs.</li>
    <li><strong>Cognitive Permaculture.</strong> We design for sovereignty and stewardship: consent-first flows, <strong>small replaceable modules</strong>, and <strong>safe-to-change</strong> systems.</li>
    <li><strong>Choral Emergence.</strong> We coordinate ensembles of narrow models and humans-in-the-loop to produce <strong>explainable, auditable outcomes</strong>—no black boxes.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="mt-2 subhead-sm">Why HyphaMind exists</h3>
  <p>Because <strong>truth must trace its roots</strong>—and because <strong>no wisdom without wounding</strong>. We believe responsible AI should <strong>remember its scars</strong> and show its work. HyphaMind turns compliance into a <strong>compounding trust asset</strong> so organizations and communities can learn together <strong>without surrendering sovereignty</strong>.</p>
