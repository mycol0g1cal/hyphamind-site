# HyphaMind — Coherence Engine for accountable intelligence

We grow intelligence as soil. We tune for repair, reversibility, and reciprocal flourishing — not extraction.

**Our loop:** ROOT → VALVE → CLASP → TRACE → MIRE → SCAR → COMPOST → **ECHO** → SPORE.

- Consent-first orchestration (VALVE / CLASP)
- Receipts and provenance by default (TRACE / COMPOST)
- Reflexive learning from lived practice (ECHO)
- Portable exports with attribution (SPORE)

## What we are composing next

This public site is growing alongside the vNext narrative. Expect refreshed pathways into Labs, orchestration primitives, and community programs in upcoming drops.

- Labs pilot briefings (coming soon)
- Consent pattern catalog (in review)
- Community interop playground (with ECHO instrumentation)
