# Web Roadmap — HyphaMind Site

This document tracks decisions and near‑term tasks for community/Web features.

## Decisions to make
- Choose “Join the community” target (platform + URL)
  - Options: Discourse, Discord, GitHub Discussions, Email list (Buttondown/Substack), Other
  - Requirements: consent‑aware onboarding, moderation rules, export/portability (SPORE‑style), receipts for invites
- Define “Introduce yourself” flow
  - Template prompts (consent, attribution preferences), optional private intake route
- Steward email routing
  - `community@hyphamind.ai` handling: ticketing vs. shared mailbox; encryption policy

## Near‑term tasks
- Draft community covenant page and link it from /community/
- Add calendar for Chorus Circles (public iCal or simple list)
- Pattern Guild index page (seed with 2–3 patterns)
- Add “Join” button target once platform is selected
- Add success/thank‑you state for join/intake

## Notes
- Keep external platforms optional; always provide a low‑barrier email introduction path
- Where possible, publish receipts for community decisions (lightweight ECHO)
